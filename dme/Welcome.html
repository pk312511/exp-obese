          <h2>authored by Xiaoyi Guo</h2>
          <p>Welcome to the decision making experiment. This research is based on Bickel et al. (2020)’s experiment investigating whether obesity could affect the behavior of risk-taking.</p>
          <p>Before you officially start, you may want to know basic information of this experiment. This experiment consists of one demographic information collection session and 21 subsessions 
            of behavioral questions. All behavioral questions are multiple choice so that you could pick one out of the three possible alternatives. This experiment may take you 20 to 30 minutes, and 
            as a compensation of your participation, you would be awarded <b>2.5 €</b> immediately after you complete all of the questions and another <b>4 €</b> after we
            examine that your data is eligible for further research needs. We strongly recommend you to read the following details, if you agree so, please click the "start the experiment" button to start experiment.</p>
          <p>Your participation in this study is purely voluntary and you will remain anonymous throughout the study. Results may include summary data, 
            but you will never be identified. By continuing, you consent to the publication of study results. </p>
