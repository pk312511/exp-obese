      <p>The option 1 - immediate payment - means that you could take your money of <b>{{player.inivalue.q01}}</b> € away immediately having no risks. You will then be redirected to your next question.</p>
      <p>The option 2 - delayed payment - means that you will have the certain amount of money as a later payment -- this payment is always higher than you original plan.</p>
      <p>The option 3 - probable payment - means that you will go for a lottery that has an observable possibility to raise your payoff -- but when you lose, you lose all things.</p>
      <p>Please alert that all of your answers are <b>individual</b> and they are not correlated with each other; the order of your trial does not matter as well.</p>
