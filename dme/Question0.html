      <p>The option 2 - delayed payment - means that you will have the certain amount of money as a later payment -- this payment is always higher than you original plan.</p>
      <p>The option 3 - probable payment - means that you will go for a lottery that has an observable possibility to raise your payoff -- but when you lose, you lose all things.</p>
