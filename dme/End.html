            <p> Probability/delay discounting refers to the decrease in 
                the subjective value of a reward as a function of a decreasing likelihood of its receipt.
                Thus, rewarding outcomes with shorter delays until their receipt and those with a greater 
                likelihood of receipt tend to have a higher subjective value than those associated with 
                longer delays or a lower likelihood. </p>
            <p>In this experiment, we calculate it via the exponential approach. 
                Exponential discounting, a cornerstone of behavioral economics, unveils why we often prioritize <b>immediate rewards over future gains</b>. 
                It encapsulates the notion that money's value diminishes over time, making a dollar today more attractive than a dollar tomorrow. 
                This phenomenon holds insights into decision-making dynamics, influencing choices about spending, saving, and more. 
                The model introduces a discount factor that quantifies our inclination toward impulsivity or patience. 
                <b>People with higher discount factors (yours: {{player.discounting}}) lean towards immediate gratification</b> , 
                while <b>those with lower factors exhibit patience</b> . 
                While exponential discounting aids in explaining our trade-offs between now and later, it also sparks discussions about the complexities of human decision-making, underscoring the delicate balance between short-term desires and long-term goals.</p>
